# Leaflet-Challenge
In this challenge Leaflet was used to visualize United States Geological data on significant Earthquakes the past 30 days. The data was imported and shown as a map with circle markers indicating earthquakes. Earthquakes with larger magnitudes appeared as larger circles. The depth of each earthquake was signified by the color of the circle.
